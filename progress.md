## Done:-
- Converted population dataset values from string to numbers using python script

## To Do:-

- Find the common countries from the datasets.
  - a) Either add the missing countries to the datasets.
  - b) Remove the missing countries from the remaining datasets.

- Build a 3D Numpy array containing countries, years and development factors as axis.

- Create new Numpy arrays containg outputs(From year 2000) : Life Expectancy, GDP, Education(Level of education for ages below 40years).

- Build a Decision Tree and Random Forest for the given inputs and outputs.

- Measure the accuracy.

- Explore different possible algorithms and measure the accuracy.


## To Try:
- First build model using decision trees & random forests and then on top of it use XGBoost algorithm.
